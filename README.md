# thread_shed_repo
Python mini project using iteration to more efficiently store data


## Description
This project was completed while doing the Codecademy Learn Python 3 course. The objective was to take a single string containing all transaction data for a sewing hobby shop called Thread Shed, and break it down into smaller, more easily-accessed lists. 

I chose to use Python for this project to reinforce concepts I am currently learning in my Software Engineering bootcamp focused on Python.

## Intended Outcome:
    - Three lists: 
        1. customers - first and last names
        2. sales - saves each transaction; enables calculation for the total daily sales
        3. thread_sold - separates thread by color and calculates quantity of each 
    - A string output for each color of thread and the corresponding quanitity sold that day
